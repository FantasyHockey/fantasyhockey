# FantasyHockey

To run from the main entry point of app.py:
- source env/bin/activate
- python3 -m fantasyhockey

- Create reusable serializers for the classes

- Go through skater stats, make sure SQL tables are efficient
    Hits, blocks, league_id don't need to be stored in skater_stats

- Update teams, seasons doesn't work
