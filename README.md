# FantasyHockey

To run from the main entry point of app.py:
- source env/bin/activate
- python3 -m fantasyhockey

TODO:

- Create team updates (Gotta think about how to structure this, maybe make many subclasses that fetch for each class)
- Create player updates
- Create Skater and Goalie Updates

New checklist:
